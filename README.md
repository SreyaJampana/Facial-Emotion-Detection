# Facial-Emotion-Detection
Trained a convolutional nueral network model to understand human facial expressions, allowing the model to predict the mood of the individual (ex: happy, sad, tired, angry, etc). The model was able to achieve 57% accuracy with a limited number of epochs. With increased data and computing power, this accuracy could be increased drastically.
